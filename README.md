# Trapkeys - Text Response Assistance Tool
This tool helps you to type repeated replies easily by pressing a combination of keys. For example, let us say that you want to wish all your 50 team-mates 'Good morning', what you generally do is type 'Good morning' 50 times in each message for each team-mate. If you are smarter, you will copy the text and paste it 50 times in messages.

With the help of this tool however, you store 'Good morning' message with a combination of your choice, let us say, 'Ctrl + Alt + G' and minimize the tool. Now whenever you press Ctrl+Alt+G, you will be provided an option to choose one message from all the messages that you stored for that combination and when you select a message, the input field will be filled with the message.
This is a gift for all the staff who have to send cliched, repetitive messages.

Hurray!
